# Anran's Note App

## Run tests

```
cd anran-note
npm install
npm run test
```

## Start at local dev

```
cd anran-note
npm install
npm start
```

## What I'll do if I had more time

1. Add confirmation for delete! Not very safe to be able to delete on one click
2. Add more validation on the input, e.g. maximum length
3. Create some more unit tests, currently only two tests on the most basic behavior. Would be nice to test the full create flow
